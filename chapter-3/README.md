NEW! - Data are now stored in the analysts' Shared Google Drive folder: [Projects/AnnRpt-Deployment-Chapter/](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1dCrXRDV9qnaMMhFY9arHteCgPMsVV3zj)

NEW! - Updates planned for spatial and temporal evaluations based on the 2024 Integrated analysis.

This will be the first "full" Annual Report since 2020, so that year's source code is used as the starting point for this year. (Note Version).

Project notes can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vXnxoBBBVOyBCfgSpFihf4-vyA_Edab62KjLO3y42ow/edit?usp=sharing).

NEW! - A new single multivariate version of the permutation tests of observer effects based on catch is on the branch mvglm_obs. This will be an appendix. Code migrated to [new repository](https://github.com/noaa-afsc/mvglm-obs) for package development.  Code on this repository is legacy archive.
