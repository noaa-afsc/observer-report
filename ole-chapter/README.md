## Purpose

The code in this repository is used to perform the analyses and associated tables and figues for the enforcement chapter of [North Pacific Observer Program Annual Reports](https://www.fisheries.noaa.gov/tags/north-pacific-observer-program?title=annual%20report&field_species_vocab_target_id=&sort_by=created).  The enforcement chapter aims to inform the public through the Council process of the potential violations with maritime law that have been reported by fishery observers.

## Organization

This repository is organized into two folders that are pretty self-explanatory

-   scripts
-   charts
-   tables

### Scripts

Five main scripts are used

-   **AR_1_get_data_queries.R** - this is the first to be run and gets the data used in the project. [It generates the output 'AR_Statements_data.rdata']{.underline}

-   **AR_2_rolling_join_scripts.R** - this file as explained calculates rates and other information used in outputs. It generates tables in .csv form that are stored in charts_and_tables folder. It uses AR_Statements_data.rdata as an input. and generates AR_summary_scripts.rdata.

-   **AR_3_rate_calcs.R** - this file as explained calculates rates and other information used in outputs. It uses AR_2_rolling_join_scripts.rdata as an input.

-   **AR_4_tables_generation.R** - Generates charts. It generates tables in .csv form that are stored in charts_and_tables folder. It uses AR_3_rate_cacls.rdata as an input.    

-   **AR_5_charts.R** - Generates charts. Uses AR_rate_calcs.rdata as input.

## Important Notes

Releases correspond to the code used for the product.  Reverting to a version will place the code at the point of the start of that project.
For this reason releases should be made when the Team has finished the product and code is considered finalized.
Outputs currently exclude confidential reporting where less than three observers are present in any given summary output.
