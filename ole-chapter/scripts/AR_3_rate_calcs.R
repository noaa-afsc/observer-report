# Impute missing units ------------

# UPDATED 20250414 To add HARD-CODED units for statements that are missing them
# but we are able to tell what they are from the UNIT_ISSUE text and/or the STATEMENT_BODY text.
# 1. If exact number of occurrences is able to be discerned from text, use that as the UNIT_ROW_MULTIPLIER
# 2. If exact number of occurrences can NOT be discerned from the text, use the MEAN for that OLE_REGULATION_SEQ as the UNIT_ROW_MULTIPLIER.
# 3. Get the INCIDENT_UNIT that is used for the regulation type from the LOV, and hardcode it.
# 4. Leave the ANSWER null; this is important because
#    we can use this later to identify if the statement had an actual unit, vs if the unit was imputed in this step.

# first look at them

# OLD - Summarize the DAYS for each factor combination. ----------

# Count deployed days.
# Frst count the SUM TOTAL of days for cruise/permit/all factors.
# This double-counts days where multiple factors occur, and is used to WEIGHT the statements in later step: WIEGHTING METHOD 1.
# Next count DISTINCT days for each cruise/permit ONLY.  Used for WIEGHTING METHOD 2.  Update: this method is not used.
# Finally count DISTINCT days for each cruise/permit/factor combination
# Weighting methods 3 and 4 are based on fishery-data-collection days as the denominator, rather than all deployment days.
# Weighting methods 3 and 4 are not currently used.

# NOTE: this may not be used for 2024 depending on what factors are used.
