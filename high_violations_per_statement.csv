Subcategory followup Questions:
Explain what happened.
The floors used in the RSW are very unsafe. They are made of tile and seem to always have a film of water or slime covering them.

Who was involved and/or present?
The observers as well as anyone who steps foot into the RSW.

Where did this take place?
This all took place in the RSW.

Explain how this affected your sampling or ability to perform your duties.
This caused us to use extreme caution when performing our sampling. The plant would not let us carry full sample baskets so that we wouldn't have the risk of slipping and falling. It was like walking on ice at times.

Did you speak to anyone about this to address or resolve it? If yes, explain any attempts to resolve.
I've spoken about it to several other observers and it seems this isn't a new issue and the plant has been notified before. We are uncertain if or when it will be resolved.

Reference applicable documents (logbook pages, deck sheets, haul forms, inseason messages, photos, screenshots, etc).
On page 201 in my daily notes I talk about a sorter slipping and falling on the tile floor. He was not injured outside of maybe some bruising. The rollerman was extremely concerned for his safety.

Provide any other details not already described.
I have come very close to falling a handful of times. I was always able to regain control before falling and injuring myself.

Subcategory followup Questions:
Explain what happened.
There is a flapper mechanism dividing the two tanks that is moved from side to side to direct fish to the intended tank. If fish are dumped to a level that is above the base of the mechanism, when it is flipped to the other side, those fish laying on top fall into the other tank instead of back into their correct tank. There is a potential for about one ton of fish to be mixed between the tanks which contain different hauls.. I witnessed this mixing once between hauls 525 and 526 while on deck, and I believe it may have also happened based on species composition during haul 441 and 442 and again during hauls 716 and 717. These were times with drastically different haul compositions, so it was easy to realize it was happening, but for hauls with similar composition I believe it was happening quite frequently and nearly every haul before it was somewhat resolved on 08/01.

Who was involved and/or present?
The deck crews and the captain Adam Loff.

Where did this take place?
The mixing happened during the dump on deck.

Explain how this affected your sampling or ability to perform your duties.
Hauls were physically mixed.

Did you speak to anyone about this to address or resolve it? If yes, explain any attempts to resolve.
I spoke with the captain Adam Loff. After 07/06 he had the deck crew start using the fire hose to push fish off of the flapper mechanism and I believed it got better. Later I realized it was still mixing because they were still filling the tanks above that level that allowed mixing to occur, and I brought it up to the captain again on 08/01. The factory manager also confirmed on 08/01 that the mixing was still happening. After that discussion, they started dumping significantly less fish in the first dump to avoid mixing.

Reference applicable documents (logbook pages, deck sheets, haul forms, inseason messages, photos, screenshots, etc).
This is documented on page 210 and 218 in the logbook. I also made a note on my deck sheets when the species composition changed drastically for about one ton during my samples and I suspected the hauls had mixed. I also took some pictures of the flapper mechanism on my NMFS-issued camera.

Subcategory followup Questions:
Explain what happened.
I regularly worked more than 12 hours in a day to keep up with the workload. 

Who was involved and/or present?
Both observers and my inseason advisor Pearl Rojas.

Where did this take place?
On the vessel.

Explain how this affected your sampling or ability to perform your duties.
I regularly had to skip samples during my shift to stay mostly caught up with data entry/checks, and I was exhausted the entire season. The first trip or two I didn't have time to perform hardly any data checks and was very behind. There were a couple times when I was so exhausted and overwhelmed that I was making scatterbrained errors in my sampling like tossing fish before recording the weight or forgetting s/l or specimens or writing numbers wrong.

Did you speak to anyone about this to address or resolve it? If yes, explain any attempts to resolve.
I spoke with my inseason advisor and we agreed to slightly reduce the sample sizes and to skip samples when needed.

Reference applicable documents (logbook pages, deck sheets, haul forms, inseason messages, photos, screenshots, etc).
I documented this on page 228 in my logbook as well as over several inseason messages throughout the season. I also made an excel spreadsheet documenting our hours and logged overtime.

Provide any other details not already described.

Subcategory followup Questions:
Explain what happened.
There is a flapper mechanism dividing the two tanks that is moved from side to side to direct fish to the intended tank. If fish are dumped to a level that is above the base of the mechanism, when it is flipped to the other side, those fish laying on top fall into the other tank instead of back into their correct tank. There is a potential for about one ton of fish to be mixed between the tanks which contain different hauls.. I witnessed this mixing once between hauls 525 and 526 while on deck, and I believe it may have also happened based on species composition during haul 441 and 442 and again during hauls 716 and 717. These were times with drastically different haul compositions, so it was easy to realize it was happening, but for hauls with similar composition I believe it was happening quite frequently and nearly every haul before it was somewhat resolved on 08/01.

Who was involved and/or present?
The deck crews and the captain Adam Loff.

Where did this take place?
The mixing happened during the dump on deck.

Explain how this affected your sampling or ability to perform your duties.
Hauls were physically mixed.

Did you speak to anyone about this to address or resolve it? If yes, explain any attempts to resolve.
I spoke with the captain Adam Loff. After 07/06 he had the deck crew start using the fire hose to push fish off of the flapper mechanism and I believed it got better. Later I realized it was still mixing because they were still filling the tanks above that level that allowed mixing to occur, and I brought it up to the captain again on 08/01. The factory manager also confirmed on 08/01 that the mixing was still happening. After that discussion, they started dumping significantly less fish in the first dump to avoid mixing.

Reference applicable documents (logbook pages, deck sheets, haul forms, inseason messages, photos, screenshots, etc).
This is documented on page 210 and 218 in the logbook. I also made a note on my deck sheets when the species composition changed drastically for about one ton during my samples and I suspected the hauls had mixed. I also took some pictures of the flapper mechanism on my NMFS-issued camera.

Subcategory followup Questions:
Explain what happened.
I regularly worked more than 12 hours in a day to keep up with the workload. 

Who was involved and/or present?
Both observers and my inseason advisor Pearl Rojas.

Where did this take place?
On the vessel.

Explain how this affected your sampling or ability to perform your duties.
I regularly had to skip samples during my shift to stay mostly caught up with data entry/checks, and I was exhausted the entire season. The first trip or two I didn't have time to perform hardly any data checks and was very behind. There were a couple times when I was so exhausted and overwhelmed that I was making scatterbrained errors in my sampling like tossing fish before recording the weight or forgetting s/l or specimens or writing numbers wrong.

Did you speak to anyone about this to address or resolve it? If yes, explain any attempts to resolve.
I spoke with my inseason advisor and we agreed to slightly reduce the sample sizes and to skip samples when needed.

Reference applicable documents (logbook pages, deck sheets, haul forms, inseason messages, photos, screenshots, etc).
I documented this on page 228 in my logbook as well as over several inseason messages throughout the season. I also made an excel spreadsheet documenting our hours and logged overtime.

Provide any other details not already described.
No other details.

Subcategory followup Questions:
Explain what happened.
The retrieval lat/longs were not recorded as last hook out. I was not receiving ELBs within two hours of the end of the haul, and I was not receiving signed ELBs daily. 

Who was involved and/or present?
The mate (Mario Reyes) was responsible for entering data and printing the ELBs.

Explain how this affected your sampling or ability to perform your duties.
I was often up to 5 days late with entering data, which often caused lack of sleep and avoidable stress. It also caused me to correct 65 hauls' worth of data before and during my debriefing.

Did you speak to anyone about this to address or resolve it? If yes, explain any attempts to resolve.
Yes. I spoke to the mate (Mario Reyes) multiple times about the need to have ELBs daily. Nothing changed. I spoke to the Captain (Dan Harnden) and either he would get data for me if he had some time, or he would wake the mate up and have him input the data and print off the ELB. 

Reference applicable documents (logbook pages, deck sheets, haul forms, inseason messages, photos, screenshots, etc).
Mentioned multiple times to my inseason and in the logbook.

Subcategory followup Questions:
Explain what happened.
There is a person on the night crew that will identify the salmon by himself and start throwing them in the bin. Even before the observer is ready to start counting. He will hold the tail se we can't ID them until they are in the bin.

Who was involved and/or present?
Sam, Me, Gillian, one of the plant workers that works on the night shift.

Where did this take place?
By the salmon station

Explain how this affected your sampling or ability to perform your duties.
It made it hard to count the salmon and id the salmon too.

Did you speak to anyone about this to address or resolve it? If yes, explain any attempts to resolve.
We told the deck boss and we told him that he can't do that.

Reference applicable documents (logbook pages, deck sheets, haul forms, inseason messages, photos, screenshots, etc).
I don't have references, because I was rarely on the salmon count for the night crew. By the other plant observers that worked at night, it happened to them too.

Subcategory followup Questions:
Explain what happened.
While monitoring for salmons in offloads, the flow of fish on the belt was ran extremely fast and very deep. Often times fish were falling off the belt and onto the ground because there were so many fish at one time. All of the fish offloaded at Sand Point would then be transported by tender vessel to be offloaded at Akutan again. There would be an initial fish ticket from Sand Point and then a finalized fish ticket from Akutan. The initial fish ticket would have a number of salmon that was found in the offload but when the finalized fish ticket would arrive most of the times there were more salmon found later at Akutan. 

Who was involved and/or present?
Trever Milich (Plant Manager), Pete Corpus (Day Foreman) and Mark Yagin (Night Foreman) were aware of the issue of after scale salmon being found at Akutan. Most of the offloads happened under Mark Yagin's direction. 

Where did this take place?
Trident Seafoods - Sand Point 

Explain how this affected your sampling or ability to perform your duties.
For GOA, we were supposed to collect genetics from every chinook and chum salmon that were in the sampled offloads. We were not able to sample from the after scale salmon. The salmon retention count would be incorrect that we recorded as well. 

Did you speak to anyone about this to address or resolve it? If yes, explain any attempts to resolve.
Yes, I spoke to Pete Corpus the Day Foreman about this issue who then directed Mark Yagin on what was to be done. He had the plant add another sorter to the belt and tried to slow the pumping of the fish. The pumping of the fish did slow down for a few offloads then it went back to the same flow of having it being as fast as possible and very deep. When I brought attention to the foreman that even with the changes that there was still salmon being found later, they responded that there was nothing else they could do. And this is when the offload speed returned to being just as fast and deep as it had been. There were still many times that fish was falling of the sorting belt because it was too high. During the night shift, I noticed they only used all six sorters when we were sampling the offload. On the unsampled offloads, they used two sorters. We were able to see the sorting belt from our sampling station. After a sampled offload, we would normally still being doing s/l so we would be able to see the offload happening and would notice that they would run the fish even faster than when we were sampling. The fish tickets still showed that there were more salmon being found in Akutan. 

Reference applicable documents (logbook pages, deck sheets, haul forms, inseason messages, photos, screenshots, etc).
Logbook entries have notes about how deep and fast the offloads flow of fish on the sorting belt appeared. Fish ticket showing the increase in number of salmon compared to the initial fish ticket. 

Provide any other details not already described.
The flow of fish during an offload would typically be ran slower when day shit was working than when night shift would take over. And day shift would always use 6 or more sorters for the belt when an offload was happening.

Subcategory followup Questions:
Explain what happened.
Captain told me that him and the crew were informed they needed to keep at least 20% of PCod during their hauls. For my two trips assigned to them, the crew then kept a strict 20% retention rate for most hauls.

Who was involved and/or present?
Captain and crew

Where did this take place?
During sampled hauls

Explain how this affected your sampling or ability to perform your duties.
Did not affect my sampling duties

Did you speak to anyone about this to address or resolve it? If yes, explain any attempts to resolve.
Crew was retaining 20% PCod on most hauls. They were very diligent about retaining 1 for every 5th PCod that came up on the line. In the first few hauls, crew was retaining 25% PCod (1 for every 4th on the line) but then PCod catch became high, so they reduced retention rate to 20%. 

Reference applicable documents (logbook pages, deck sheets, haul forms, inseason messages, photos, screenshots, etc).
Noted in daily notes (pg 27 and 29) and deck forms

Provide any other details not already described.
For most of the hauls, PCod catch was so high that an automatic 20%/25% retention rate (respectively) was given to the hauls because the crew was so strict on keeping 1 of every 5 Pcod. Towards the end of the hauls, PCod retention rate got more varied, so discard tallies were kept and individual haul retention rates were calcualted.

Subcategory followup Questions:
Explain what happened.
The door to the food color which is a watertight door was tied open the entire time I was on the vessel. My second Eva brought it to my attention. She said the cook said it is because the freezer won't work without airflow. 

Who was involved and/or present?
The cook : Jerry, Eva, and me

Where did this take place?
The door to the food cooler on the starboard side of the vessel.

Explain how this affected your sampling or ability to perform your duties.
This didn't affect my sampling duties. 

Did you speak to anyone about this to address or resolve it? If yes, explain any attempts to resolve.
I didn't I was told that Eva had already talked to the cook. She told me she had shut the door and the cook had told her she couldn't do that because the freezer would no longer work because it needed airflow.

Subcategory followup Questions:
Explain what happened.
ELB would be given at least 1-2 days after a haul has finished. Also, flowscale percent error signs would be opposite: if the percent calculated was 1.33, they would give it to us as -1.33 or if it was -0.45, the ELB would be given to us as +0.45.

Who was involved and/or present?
Purser, my second, night foreman

Explain how this affected your sampling or ability to perform your duties.
This affected data checking, and if there was an error in the data, then it would take longer to get the corrected form. The ELB flowscale percent error was never fixed. 

Did you speak to anyone about this to address or resolve it? If yes, explain any attempts to resolve.
Purser, inseason

Reference applicable documents (logbook pages, deck sheets, haul forms, inseason messages, photos, screenshots, etc).
logbook, inseason messages, ELB

Provide any other details not already described.
We brought it up with our inseason a number of times, but it was never fixed.

During my assignment, I witnessed 103 instances of mixing bags.

Noted on page 215 on 02/27/2022, the mixing of hauls 100 and 101 and hauls 102 and 103. Throughout the first couple of trips, the vessel was conducting the production samples without switching over haul numbers on the flowscale which mixed the hauls most likely from about 50 kg to 150 kg. I noticed this finally when I glanced at the flowscale after finishing a sample while crew were doing a production sample. When I was leaving the factory the flowscale number did not match my final sample number and then it clicked in my head what was going on. I spoke with John about this and we notified the factory manager/foreman to switch the haul numbers. I logged this in my logbook on page 209 on 02/13/2022 . The factory was amenable to this switch to not mix hauls and the two instances for haul 100 and 101 and 102 and 103, the factory immediately notified John and I about accidently not switching the hauls back on the flowscale. We were able to add and substract the given errored amount to all hauls which was also noted on our decksheets, and we sent out an email to notify the bridge to update the elbs accordingly.","LIMITED ACCESS PROGRAMS",2022,NA,NA,"OLD",2022,"LIMITED ACCESS

During my assignment, I witnessed 96 instances of mechanical sample biasing. There are three belts between the live tank doors and the flowscale. The belt just before the flowscale is at an angle so that the fish fall onto a metal slide occasionally between the belt and the flowscale. As the fish add and pile up on that metal piece they fall between the crack below the belt before the flowscale. It appeared that the metal piece was broken too. The vessel would put orange baskets where the fish fell to catch them. I had assumed the vessel was then dumping those fish onto the belts periodically and before they finished the haul. I caught a crew member dumping that fish onto the sorting belt past the flowscale at one point and pointed this out to Nicole. Nicole spoke with the factory manager Chris who said that never happened on his shift and that he would talk to the guys on my shift. Nicole caught them dumping fish onto the sorting belt on her shift too. ","OLE PRIORITY: SAFETY AND DUTIES",2022,NA,NA,"OLD",2022,"OLE PRIORITY:

I have served as an observer on 5 deployments.  During this deployment, I was assigned aboard the Arica delivering to Dutch Harbor from 04/19/2022 to 07/05/2022.  During my assignment, I witnessed 222 instances of fish falling out of the flowscale and unable to be collected during the sampling process.

Due to the setup of the flowscale on The Arica, fish would fall out of it before the collection point for sampling. This means that some of the catch would be lost while collecting a sample, causing a small bias. It should be noted that this issue takes place once fish have been weighed by the flowscale, so in that sense the entire haul itself is weighed correctly, but this became an issue for the MCP/FS comparison data I needed to collect, in which the vast majority of data points collected on this vessel showed a large discrepancy (5-10kh on average) between the flowscale weight and the actual sample weight derived from the MCP scale, and in all instances the flowscale weight was larger than the actual sample weight. The vast majority of drop offs that occurred consisted of smaller flatfish and various invertebrates, although a substantial amount of larger sized flatfish (estimated to be about 50kg per haul) also slipped through and were therefore unavailable for processing/sampling. Rex sole were particularly bad and hauls that had large amounts of rex sole had more fish dropping off. This has been documented thoroughly in my inseason messages for this deployment with Alex as my inseason advisor. Also a single photo of the amount of fish falling off was taken for documentation and submitted with my data. I brought the issue up with the first mate, Ron Amy. This issue was somewhat mitigated when the sorting line was run slowly and steadily, like when the deck boss Jerry would run fish. Conversely, the issue would be exacerbated when fish was ran incredibly fast.

This violation occurred with every haul, seen in the fact that after every haul that finished a pile of fish would be present beneath the flowscale. During sample collection, the bias could be somewhat accounted for by placing extra baskets where fish would fall out, but due to the placement of a plastic wall and a gap in the grating right beneath the drop off, there was no feasibly method to catch absolutely all of the drop offs. The only recommended action to fix the violation was to inform the sorters to run fish slower, but this proved ineffective and the issue persisted.

Based on my observations, the only practical fix would be to uninstall the flowscale and reinstall it so that the flowscale was situated above the belt that the sorters use, not in parallel with a gap between the two belts. However, such a fix would cost the vessel a lot of money and would only be available in shipyard while the vessel isn't currently fishing. Realistically, this violation did not impede my work n a relevant manner, a small and consistent sample bias and an error in the MCP/FS comparison data were not enough to warrant me to alter my sampling methods beyond placing extra baskets down to catch as much of the drop offs as possible. IF anything, this issue affects the vessel's production in the sense that they lose approximately 1-2 cases every haul, and possibly more depending on how bad the drop offs are.","LIMITED ACCESS PROGRAMS",2022,NA,NA,"OLD",2022,"LIMITED ACCESS

"29",27550,"Pollock",NA,2022-01-18,100,NA,"Intimidation, coercion, hostile work environment","OLE-ONGOING","MARSDEN","2202243",NA,"PETER PAN SFDS LLC - KING COVE","Y",25387,35448,"I, SEAN KOBEL, was employed by SALTWATER INC. to serve as a groundfish observer for the National Marine Fisheries Service.  I have served as an observer on 5 deployments.  During this deployment, I was assigned at the processing plant PETER PAN SFDS LLC - KING COVE in KING COVE from 01/18/2022 to 04/04/2022.  During my assignment, I experienced a hostile work environment due to the behavior of my second Phil More (c25397) His aggressive, belligerent behavior drastically increased my workload and stress.

I spoke with my in-season advisor and provider in response to his unprofessional behavior. Angered by this, Phil attempted to provoke me on an almost daily basis by a variety of methods, including altering and hiding paperwork as well as arriving late, giving me inaccurate information related to vessels and attempting to bully me into changing aspects of my work schedule to better suit his preferences. I have summarized several examples of this behavior below. I included more detailed examples in my daily notes. Working with him was simply horrible. I would quit my position as an observer before accepting another assignment with him.

Initially, Phil was meant to be the lead observer as he had more experience. Upon his arrival, he asked me to be the lead. I asked him why and he launched into an hour-long monologue that frankly made no sense. I agreed to be the lead and spoke with my in-season and provider. Before the first boat arrived, I spoke with him regarding scheduling shifts. I also spoke with him regarding my sample plan. He argued nearly every possible aspect of basic observer protocol. I generally gave him his way in exhaustion as it was simply easier than arguing.

An example of this is scheduling hours. I wanted the standard 12/12 plant shift as only 2 of us are there, and the plant runs 24/7. Phil wanted 2on/2off. I spoke with him for hours, trying to convince him that being on call 24/7 was impractical as offloads could take 15-30hours, and I needed to sleep. He laughed at my need for sleep stating, youre one of those people who needs 8hours of sleep. Just tough it out. This issue came to a head-on 1/30 when Phil yelled at me in front of the processors. I had attempted to compromise with him and agreed to do 2on/2off with a 4/4 around midnight to allow for at least a moderate amount of sleep. That night he arrived at midnight, and the plant had decided to stop to enable the sorters to sleep. I told him they would start at 8 am, and I would come 2 hours after. The following day I arrived at 10 am, and he proceeded to scream obscenities at me in front of the entire pollock sorting line. I was shocked. He saw everyone staring at him after screaming and immediately ran out of the sorting line while I called after him to come back. I went to his room on my lunch break and told him his behavior was unprofessional and unacceptable. I informed him that I would need to speak with NMFS and our provider about it if it continued. I spoke in a normal tone at his front door. I never raised my voice even when he repeatedly yelled in my face with spittle hitting my cheeks.

Another example: I wanted to start the offload stopwatch when the pump started and only stop it for breaks. Phil wanted to run the stopwatch only when he could see the belt moving. As it is a hopper scale, this meant starting and stopping the stopwatch multiple times per minute. I told him I was not comfortable using this measurement system as it added an extra confounding variable and added nothing. Phil agreed that I was the boss. He then promptly used his method anyway, which caused my sample frame to be wildly off as his method produced an extremely short offload time. Ex: a 15hour offload would be 4-5hours using the Phil method.

Another example: on 1/31, Phil insisted again on 2hour shifts arguing endlessly despite the impracticality of being on call for 24hours. In exhaustion, I agreed and ended up staying up all night.

During the first few weeks, he would regularly enter my room without my permission and sit on the floor. He often took his shoes off and stretched. Phil smells awful. Once, I regularly told him to leave my room. I politely said, forexample, Im working right now; please leave. Phil: Why dont you just tell me to get the F*(k out then. Me: Phil, just go. Im trying to work.

On 2/2, while I was going through fish tickets and filling out offload forms, Phil knocked on my door. He pushed past me when I opened it and rifled through my paperwork. As I dont have a desk, the fish tickets were organized by date in piles across the floor. He took a variety of them. I asked what he was doing. He responded that he needed these. I asked why, and he left with the paperwork. Rather than argue with him further, I decided to get the fish tickets and deck sheets back later.

On 2/3, I got most of the paperwork back from Phil. One fish ticket he hid from me, only to be found months later and cause a separate issue documented in my in-season messages and daily notes. He regularly harassed me about the work laptop. I believe it was a control issue for him. He would ask for it while I was doing paperwork, as I regularly did in the evenings. I would tell him he could have it when I was finished. He would argue and harass me until I gave it to him, exasperated. This evening, 2/3, he came back into the room after I gave in and handed him the laptop. He said there was an important message for me from our in-season. I logged in and looked at the messages. There was not a message. He then grabbed the laptop from my hands and began looking through my in-season messages. I told him his behavior was inappropriate, took the laptop back from him, and closed it. He became angry, grabbed my open logbook, and began rifling through it, asking what I had written about him. I told him to leave. I never raised my voice or touched him physically, despite him yelling in my face again.

On 2/4, I called my in-season and discussed what had occurred with Phil, specifically his attempting to read my logbook and in-season messages.

On 2/5, Phil harassed me about the computer again, came into my room, took his shoes off, and left them on my floor. They smelled absolutely foul, and I have no doubt he was attempting to intimidate me.

On 2/6, He continued to harass me regarding the usage of the laptop. As I was doing nearly all the paperwork, I told him he was welcome to use the computer to message the in-season, but I needed it back afterward. This was mainly because he tends to disappear for days on end, and I cannot find him. Unfortunately, neither can the plant staff. This disappearing act occurred many times. It even happened when law enforcement was doing a routine patrol at King Cove.

On 2/8, several of the pollock sorters (Caiden and John) spoke with me about him yelling at them. I asked why he would yell at them, and they said they were looking in the salmon bin. The sorting area at king cove is an extremely tight space, so there isnt much wiggle room. Looking at the salmon bin for a sorter is essentially rotating your torso and looking over your shoulder.

After speaking with my provider and my in-season regarding these issues and them speaking with Phil, his behavior changed drastically. He changed from being an aggressive bully to suddenly pretending to be terrified of me. The change was surprising, to say the least. I had been screamed at by him on more than one occasion and regularly bullied into doing things in his preferred method. I told him that I only wanted to speak regarding work-related issues. Rather than detail all of the strange things he did to mess with me, I will summarize. He would erase page numbers, hide paperwork, rearrange deck sheet information, give me false and misleading information to inconvenience me, or for example, send me out onto the docks in 50mph winds and heavy snow when there was no boat. He often arrived late, explaining that he was busy. He often disappeared, and I would not see him for days. His behavior exponentially increased my workload and stress level. I have detailed many more examples in my daily notes.

The captain's noted he recorded the deployment information when the net started to fish. This information is recorded on the fishing effort page in my observer logbook and in my vessel survey.","ALL OTHER STATEMENT TYPES",2022,NA,NA,"OLD",2022,"ALL OTHER

I have served as an observer on 4 deployments.  During this deployment, I was assigned aboard the Enterprise delivering to Dutch Harbor from 04/01/2023 to 06/22/2023.  During my assignment, I witnessed many, up to 150 instances of various Amendment 80 violations such as refusal to clear belts, mixing of hauls both physically and on paper, and deck sort table not being secured to the floor on deck.
First off, the decksort table was a metal rectangular table that was in no way secured to the floor. I was moved often during times when we were unable to do decksort, and was tied down with ropes when not in use off the the side of the deck. When it was in use, there was usually one rope tying a leg of the table to a pole near the trawl alley so the table wouldn't slide. However, if the weather was even slightly bad, a little bit of wave action, or even if someone leaned against the edge of the table during decksort, the table would tip back into my waist, sometimes almost completely knocking me down and falling over if the weather was really bad, but usually sending the table edge tipping back into my stomach until I leaned forward against it and braced it back into place. Secondly, there were several instanced where hauls were either dumped into tanks that still had a number of old fish in them, they forgot to reset the flowscale at the end of a haul and ran some weight of the new haul under the old haul, or reset the flowscale, and then rinsed out the tanks, so old fish would be recorded as the first 100kg give or take of the new haul. A big example of this was one haul where almost 1/2 of the fish in each sample was decomposing, old, mushy yellowfin. We ended up getting an error message that yellowfin was out of range, so I discussed with my inseason and changed all the yellowfin in that haul's species comp to fish waste because it was all old and broken fish that had gotten stuck or just not been rinsed out of the tank the previous haul. More examples of haul mixing can be seen in my daily notes for  05/11/23 and 06/05/23. ","LIMITED ACCESS PROGRAMS",2023,NA,NA,"OLD",2023,"LIMITED ACCESS

Upon boarding the vessel and sampling my first haul on 04/01 and 04/02/23 I was told to collect my own samples, and when I went to collect my first sample, the individual running the belt and the tanks pointed out the levers to me to open and close the tanks, start and stop the incline belt, and start and stop the sort belt so I could obtain my sample, and walked away. I have never encountered anything like this on another vessel, my sample was always poured for me. I spent the first almost half of my contract on the Enterprise working the tanks and running the belt to pour my own samples and obtain fish, and therefore was not clearing the belt because that would have required more effort in an already difficult task, and left me responsible for sorting fish, opening and closing tanks as needed, etc, which is not my job, and unsafe. When I was in charge of collecting my own samples and things happened like I did leave the tank open or the belt running, factory personnel would confront me upset for ""flooding and overloading the belt,"" losing good fish, or not discarding/sorting fish correctly, even though this is not my responsibility. I understand that the belt not being clear creates a biased sample in some instances, but I did not have to ability, the know-how, or the responsibility to conduct these operations. However, there were numerous occasions where the belt had been left clear when I went to collect a sample, and all I had to do was open a tank and start the incline belt to get fish for my sample.
