# Description
This (Annual) Report provides information, analysis, and recommendations based on the deployment of observers and Electronic Monitoring (EM) systems by the North Pacific Observer Program (Observer Program) in the halibut and groundfish fisheries off Alaska.  The report is a collaborative effort between the Fisheries Monitoring and Analysis Division (FMA) of the AFSC and the Sustainable Fisheries Division of the Alaska Regional Office (AKRO-SF). The NMFS presents this report to the North Pacific Fishery Management Council during its October meeting.  The report is also reviewed by the Council's various advisory bodies and occasionally Science and Statistical Committee. 

Specifically, this repository contains code to generate elements in report chapters.  Each chapter is organized into a separate folder.
* Fees and Budget (costs)
* Deployment Performance Review
* Office of Law Enforcement Chapter
* Descriptive Information (Total Catch and Discards and Amount of Catch Monitored)

Reports are submitted by NMFS to the North Pacific Fishery Management Council during their October meeting.
