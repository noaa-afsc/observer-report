This ADP is complicated by the presence of three temporal (unplanned) stratum caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.  Refer to the Final 2020 ADP for reference (in docs folder).

Starting in March, 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic created limitations on available air travel and “shelter in place” restrictions, 
particularly in many remote Alaskan communities. Under the emergency rule signed on March 24, 2020, NMFS temporarily waived the requirement 
for vessels in the Partial Coverage Category to carry a fishery observer from March 27 through April 19, 2020. On April 18, 2020, NMFS announced 
a limited extension of the temporary waiver of observer requirements, which narrowed the scope and reinitiated deployment of observers on trips 
departing from the port of Kodiak, Alaska (the majority of GOA trawl fisheries occurred out of Kodiak during this timeframe). On June 28, 2020, 
NMFS expanded observer deployment in the partial coverage category to include 13 ports in addition to Kodiak, which further reduced the scope of 
waivers issued.

The largest component of the Alaskan groundfish fisheries, vessels, and processors in the full coverage category (including catcher processors and 
participants in limited access privilege programs), were not issued waivers in 2020. Additionally, requirements for deployment of EM was not waived 
for trawl catcher vessels fishing under the trawl EM exempted fishing permit and only a few trips were released from coverage under the fixed gear 
EM portion of the partial coverage category for circumstances when an EM service technician was unable to travel.

The Team noted on Jan 4 2021 that the evaluations post June 28 would still be sample vs entire population and not just the sampling frame because 
that is what the data is used for.  The same observer effects would be applied for that period as well.
